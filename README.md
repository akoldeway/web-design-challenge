# Web Visualization Dashboard - LatitudeVs.

## Project Overview

LatitudeVs. is a site built to provide vizualizations illustrating the difference in climate for cities depending on how far away they are from  the equator.  This site will identify if temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed are impacted by a city's location to the equator.  Along with the four visualizations a comparison page is provided to see all four visualizations together.  Finally a data page is provided with the dataset used to create visualizations.

A navigation bar is provided across the top of the page to allow for easy access to the different areas of the site.  The home page along with each visualization page provides easy navigation to each chart along the bottom of the page.
